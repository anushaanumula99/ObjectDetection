# Object Detection using Deep learning and Open CV


Using this model, we can detect and classify the real time objects in a video or realtime stream and label the objects provided with anchor boxes around showing the confidence of the predicition it made. It uses Tensorflow Deep learning Framework and Open Cv for Image Processing.

Creating accurate machine learning models capable of localizing and identifying
multiple objects in a single image remains a core challenge in computer vision.
The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of
TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train and deploy object detection
models.  At Google weâ€™ve  found this codebase to be useful.
